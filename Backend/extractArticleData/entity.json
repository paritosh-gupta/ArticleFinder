\outl0\strokewidth0 Maisie Williams, known for portraying Arya Stark on the HBO epic Game of Thrones, has added YouTube creator to her burgeoning resume with the\'a0launch of her own channel this morning. Williams released the first episode of "Random Moments of Madness With Maisie Williams," which featured the Game of Thrones star answering fans' questions in celebration of reaching 1 million Twitter followers. "I have a lot of friends, and I just find it really interesting in what they do, and I thought I'd give it a shot myself," says Williams in the video below. She noted that she won't post to the channel regularly, however. "It will just be every now and then, something that made me smile or an idea that I had to let my creative juices out." Check out her first video below: In the four-minute-plus video, Williams sheds a light on things such as her pet peeves, best childhood memory, her nicknames growing up, and a moment on Game of Thrones that made her cry. (Spoiler alert for those who haven't seen the Season 5\'a0finale: Williams discusses the fate of her character.) The video also features a blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo from one her co-stars. This isn't the first time Williams has shown up on YouTube\'97she has previously appeared on shows hosted by Caspar Lee and The Fine Brothers. Game of Thrones will enter the 2016 Guinness Book of World Records for largest simultaneous broadcast of a television drama; the second episode of the show's fifth season was simulcast to 173 countries and territories in April. The show will return for its sixth season next year.\
